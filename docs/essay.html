    <body> When learning new things you may feel challenged, I would say the most difficult things for a new learner is for sure learning how whatever the person is learning. You need to be familiar with it and repatative so you truly understand what you are doing. 
        One advantage I prefer is repatition. When I repeat things over again I tend to understnd better, it is like learning how to do something then just doing it by muscle memory. 
        Some challenges I have had for modifying the layout and organization for each site is simple things, I am having trouble with trying to figure out things such as background color and color of text. I think that over time and if I reach out for help I will be able to figure it out within minutes.
        I woukd say some skills that are necessary to learn and develop these sites in either format is learning to use your resources. Things like CSS and other types of coding. It would be very helpful to understand the program you use as well. 
        Some skills I think would want to learn to improve on this website is getting those skills down so I can do this and make a website look flawless. As of now there are still lots I do not know. I think if I can get down and understand the things I would have a good looking website.
        I hope soon that my website will be a very good looking website and will be completed correctly.
